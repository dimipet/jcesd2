# jcesd2

## Information
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is one of the most common screening tests for helping an individual to determine his or her depression quotient [1]. This simple app is just a tech upgrade since its ancestor [2] uses deprecated tech-stack. This app's translation and (scale) standardization was held by Konstantinos N. Fountoulakis, MD, Professor of Psychiatry (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University Hospital Thessaloniki, Greece) [3].

## Purpose
This app's main objective was to collect and save questionnaire data from subjects.

## Run

`mvn clean package`

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.dimipet.jcesd2.App`
